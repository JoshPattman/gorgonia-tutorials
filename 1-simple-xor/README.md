# Simple XOR Example
## What does this tutorial do?
In this tutorial we create a simple 3 layer dense neural network using `gorgonia.org/gorgonia` to learn the XOR function with backpropagation. To get started, read the code and comments in `main.go`.
## Why is this tutorial so verbose?
This tutorial is designed to be as barebones as possible to help a complete begginner to understand gorgonia. In reality, you would wrap much of the neural net up in a struct, and be a lot less verbose.
