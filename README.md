# `gorgonia-tutorials` - Some code-focussed tutorials to help a beginner learn `gorgonia.org/gorgonia`
This repo is a collection of tutorials I have put together for `gorgonia`. I am still learning the framework myself but I think that means I can write these in a way a complete beginner can easily understand. Before you try your hand at these, you should probably have a basic understanding of neural networks, and also how you can represent neural networks as a graph.

Each tutorial is just some heavily commented go files. I prefer to learn this way so thats how I've written them.

To check out the gorgonia project, head on over to [gorgonia.org](gorgonia.org).
